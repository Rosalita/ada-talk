* How to Resurrect a PyPortal

doubleclick the reset button to get to portal boot

Then download and put a .uf2 file on it to wipe it

Then install circuit python again

Then Connect to PyPortal via linux terminal
ls /dev/ttyACM*
will output the boards name e.g.
/dev/ttyACM0

Then use screen to connect to it
sudo screen /dev/ttyACM0 115200

To completely erase the board 
>>> import storage
>>> storage.erase_filesystem()

* Verdict on PyPortal

Needs power, works well connected to a desktop PC

The temperature sensor is rather rubbish

It also has a light sensor on it so you can wave at it to wake it up

It's fast to change code 

Lots of sample code and projects available online

Definitely worth getting if have any interest in learning/writing Python code
